        to colonize Mar's?</b></p>
    <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elon Musk said, " He have Two
        reasons one is kind of a defensive reasons that like is something will
        happen to earth... like a meteor, super natural disaster&nbsp; or like a
        something that will destroyed like the one the&nbsp; destroyed the
        dinosauars, super volcanoes or world war 111.&nbsp; We could nuke each
        other to died or something in those handing where humanity will
        destroyed itself, World War 111 is seeming a little more probable in
        these day right now where more likely to happen. So I want to colonize
        Mar's to be like Earth where we can see animal and where living thing
        will not be destroyed. So that why we need to colonize Mar's.<br>
